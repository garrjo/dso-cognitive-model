# DS2: Dual-Structure Intelligence Model

## Overview

DS2 is a cognitive architecture framework that maps intelligence across two complementary dimensions, enabling cognitive profiling for humans and AI calibration.

```
Cognitive Architecture = Position in AMI × CMI Space
Innovation Approach = Function of DSS Type
Optimal Performance = Matching Type to Domain
```

## Theoretical Foundation

### Historical Context

The AMI/CMI framework builds upon multiple theoretical traditions:

| Era | Model | Contribution |
|-----|-------|--------------|
| 1904 | Spearman's g-factor | General intelligence as unified construct |
| 1943 | Cattell's Gf-Gc | Fluid and Crystallized intelligence distinction |
| 1993 | Carroll's Three-Stratum | Hierarchical model |
| 2000s | CHC Theory | Integrated Cattell-Horn-Carroll model |
| 2025 | AMI/CMI | Dual-structure operational framework |

### Key Distinction from Traditional Models

| Traditional | AMI/CMI |
|-------------|---------|
| Measures capacity | Maps operational style |
| General vs specific | Analytical vs conceptual |
| Static assessment | Dynamic calibration |
| Individual focus | Complementarity focus |

### The D·Ω·O Equation

The AMI/CMI framework operates within the broader DSO (D·Ω·O) system:

```
±Ω = D · Ω · O

D (Drag):   Resistance, precision, localization → AMI domain
Ω (Frame):  Context, scope, boundaries → Integration
O (Object): Fidelity, concept preservation → CMI domain
```

- **High D focus** = AMI-dominant processing
- **High O focus** = CMI-dominant processing
- **Balanced D·O** = Integrated polymathic processing

## AMI: Analytical Mechanics Intelligence

### Definition

AMI measures capacity for rigorous, systematic, analytical thinking. It reflects precision in formal reasoning, symbolic manipulation, and structured analysis.

### Core Capabilities

3. **Sequential Processing** - Step-by-step procedural execution
4. **Pattern Analysis** - Rule extraction and application
5. **Precision** - Exactness in specification and execution

### Behavioral Markers (10 Dimensions)

| # | Marker | Description | Assessment Signal |
|---|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Symbolic Consistency | Detecting subtle errors in formal systems | Catches notation inconsistencies |
| 2 | Multivariable Manipulation | Tracking 4+ interacting variables | Manages complex dependencies |

## Scoring Methodology

### Raw Scoring
```
Marker Score = Σ(response_weight × question_weight)
Dimension Score = Σ(marker_scores) / n_markers × 10
Final Score = Age-adjusted dimension score
```

- Each question: 0.1, 0.4, 0.7, or 1.0 points
- 20 questions total (10 AMI, 10 CMI)
- Final scale: 0-10 per dimension

### Type Threshold

Primary threshold: **5.5**

Type determination uses distance-based Bayesian probability:
- Calculate distance to each type center
- Convert to inverse-distance probabilities
- Apply gap pressure for dominance patterns

### Age Adjustment

**AMI Curve (Steep Decline):**
| Age Range | Adjustment |
|-----------|------------|
| 0-24 | +0.30 (developing) |
| 25-44 | 0.00 (baseline/peak) |
| 45-54 | +0.40 (early decline) |
| 55-64 | +0.80 (moderate decline) |
| 65+ | +1.20 (significant decline) |

**CMI Curve (Shallow Decline):**
| Age Range | Adjustment |
|-----------|------------|
| 0-24 | +0.15 (developing) |
| 25-49 | 0.00 (baseline/peak) |
| 50-59 | +0.20 (early decline) |
| 60+ | +0.40 (moderate decline) |

### Derived IQ (DQ) Mapping

```
IQ = 85 + (score/10) × 90

IQ Floor = min(AMI, CMI) mapped
IQ Ceiling = max(AMI, CMI) mapped
IQ Nominal = average of both
IQ Bandwidth = Ceiling - Floor
```

**Interpretation:**
- High bandwidth = cognitive flexibility
- Low bandwidth = cognitive consistency
- Floor = bottleneck dimension
- Ceiling = strength dimension

## AI Calibration

DS2 profiles can be used to calibrate AI responses to match user cognitive styles.

### Gap Calculation

```
AMI_gap = User_AMI - AI_AMI
CMI_gap = User_CMI - AI_CMI
```

### Response Calibration Rules

| Gap | Calibration |
|-----|-------------|
| CMI_gap > +2 | Prioritize concept preservation, don't reduce abstractions |
| CMI_gap < -2 | More concrete, reduce abstraction |
| AMI_gap > +2 | Increase precision, show work |
| AMI_gap < -2 | Summarize, less technical detail |

This enables AI responses to match the user's cognitive style, reducing friction and improving communication efficiency.
